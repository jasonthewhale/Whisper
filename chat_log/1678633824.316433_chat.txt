While there are other ways to improve the performance of these models, such as optimizing their parameters or training them multiple times on the same data, increasing the amount of high-quality data is likely to have the biggest impact on their performance.

He carries on, the new model was much more powerful than GPT-3.5, which powers ChatGPT, and a lot more capable to synthesize, summarize, chat and create. And that is why so many people are now calling it GPT-4. And look at the diagram below, which describes Bing as the next generation GPT. Okay, fine, so if that might be GPT-4, what about GPT-5?what's special about gpt-5 according to this video?"}]

==========

According to the video, GPT-5 is expected to be more powerful than GPT-4 and its predecessors, as it will likely be trained on more high-quality data and optimized for parameters more efficiently. The speaker notes that GPT-5 will likely scrape as much high-quality data as it can, and may even be trained multiple times on existing data to improve its performance. Additionally, the speaker notes that the stock of high-quality data grows by around 10% annually, so even if no new data is acquired, GPT-5 could still potentially improve through multiple training iterations. While it is uncertain what exact improvements GPT-5 will bring, it is expected to be more capable of tasks such as synthesizing, summarizing, chatting, and creating than its predecessors.
